A Python application that allows users to upload their code and terminal output, and have a Deepseek AI Coder model automate any bug fixing challenges. This will be done by the model running in a containerized environment, actually running the code and getting it's output, then repeating this process until there are no errors. The application will also be able to fix semantic errors, by having the code itself and the output currently being generated, as well as the intended output.
